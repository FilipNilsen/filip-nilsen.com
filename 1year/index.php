<h1>One year online</h1>
<p>
Well, this site has been up for a year now and i would like to thank everybody who has read on it.<br>
The sad bit is that according to google search console, nobody has visited this site yet! Which means that for the moment I'm writing this for myself.<br>
I am, however also writing this for the future and whomever might read it then, if you're one of those people, thank you!<br>
I do have some plans:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn JavaScript</li>
<li>Paranormal stuff</li>
</ul><p>
The first one is self-explanatory, but the third might cause confusion.<br>
I am a skeptic so i though it might be fun to debunk stories of people who claimed to be abducted by aliens, have photos of aliens or general conspiracy theories.<br>
Otherwise i will do more of the OS stuff and bootleg games stuff.<br>
I do have two plug-and-plays and some similar stuff. That i might review one day.<br>
There might be a possibility that i change the domain from <a href="fillanilla.github.io">FillaNilla.github.io</a> to <a href="FilipNilsen.github.io">FilipNilsen.github.io</a> <i>so, you might wanna bookmark that, in case i change it.</i></p>
<p>Whatever the future brings, Thank you for reading!!</p>
