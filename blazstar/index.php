<h1>The worst English I've ever seen in a video game</h1>
<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazing_Star"><u>Blazing Star</u></a> is a video game released for the SNK NEOGEO in 1998<br>
The game is pretty good, however the same can not be said for the English in the game. So here is a quick look at it.<br>

The fist boss is not to bad<hr>

The second boss however, is pretty shit<hr>

It gets good again at the third boss<hr>

And then it gets back to shit<hr>

It's a pretty long boss so yeah, it's huge<hr>

It's the last boss, and let's just say: they saved the best for last<hr>
