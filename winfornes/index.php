			<h1>Windows on NES !!</h1>
			<p>
				<strong>Have you ever wanted to run Microsoft Windows on NES? Well of course not! <br>
				However, the bootleggers could not hear you out on that and did it anyway.</strong>
			</p>
			<strong>The following versions of Windows exist for NES:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#chw2000">Windows 2000 (Chinese)</a></li>
				<li><a href="#98">Windows 98</a></li>
				<li><a href="#edu2000">Educational Computer 2000</a></li>
				<li><a href="#ruw2000">Windows 2000 (Russian)</a></li>
			</ul></strong>
			<p>
				The reason for these fake operating systems existence is probably to provide keyboard famiclones with fake operating systems. 
				Some famiclones (fake illegal bootlegged hardware clones of the NES) pretended to be computers. 
				These would feature keyboard, mouse and controller. Some would even feature a floppy disk drive.
				The software would usually be stored on ROM cartridge.
